# PONTEA - Inclusive Learning Platform for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder

Welcome to the PONTEA project repository! Our platform is designed to create inclusive learning environments for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It offers teachers a collaborative space to share and discover customized activities that enhance engagement and development in children with ASD.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the PONTEA project on your local machine.

    ```
    Replace your-username with your GitHub username
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:

### Running the Project

Once you've completed the installation process, you can run the PONTEA project using Quasar:

The PONTEA platform should now be up and running, ready for you to explore its features and functionalities.

## Contribution

1. **Create a new branch.** Once you have forked the repository, you need to create a new branch for your contribution. This will help you keep your changes separate from the main code of the project.
Open a terminal and go to the directory of the forked repository. Then, run the following command to create a new branch:

    ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/[name of the feature]
    ```
    The name of the branch should be descriptive of the feature you are adding or fixing.

2. **Make your changes.** Once you have created a new branch, you can start making your changes to the code. Make sure to follow the project's coding style guidelines and test your changes before pushing them.

3. **Push your changes to your repository.** Once you have made your changes, you can push them to your repository.


Open a terminal and go to the directory of the forked repository. Then, run the following command to push your changes:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "message here"
git push origin feature/[name of the feature]
```
4. **Submit a pull request to the main repository.** Once you have pushed your changes to your repository, you can submit a pull request to the main repository. This will request that the project team merge your changes into the main code of the project.
   
    Open a terminal and go to the directory repository. Then, run the following command to submit a pull request:
    ```sh
    git pull request
    ```
   
You will be prompted to provide a description of your pull request. Make sure to provide a clear and concise description of what you are changing and why.

You will also be prompted to provide a title for your pull request. The title should be descriptive of what you are changing and should be easy to read.

Review and approve your changes. Once you have submitted your pull request, the project team will review your changes and approve or reject them. If your changes are approved, they will be merged into the main code of the project.
